		Virat Kohli (born 5 November 1988)[b] is an Indian 
		international cricketer who plays Test and ODI cricket 
		for the national team and is a former captain in all 
		formats.[5] He is a right-handed batsman and an 
		occasional right arm medium pace bowler. He is called 
		the king, the chase master and the run machine for his 
		playing style, records and ability to lead the team to 
		victory.[6] Kohli is the highest run-scorer in the Indian 
		Premier League, third in T20I, third in ODI, and third in 
		international cricket.
